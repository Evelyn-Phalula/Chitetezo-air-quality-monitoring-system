IoT HARMFUL GASES MONITORING SYSTEM.
Air pollution is a global issue and many countries including
Malawi are facing this problem, especially in urban areas. 
Air pollution is a result of harmful gases, which are released 
Into the air from homes, industrial areas, and other places 
that use appliances or systems that use gases.

Recently studies have found that unburned gas leaks from stoves 
and this gas contain benzene a known carcinogen that can cause 
respiratory problems they can also release other air pollutants
into the air which are toxic to people and pets. As a result,
it is necessary to monitor them and find solutions on how to 
overcome them based on the data that has been collected electronically.
However, monitoring systems for air pollution in Malawi are scarce. 
Hence, it is hard for people to know if their surroundings are affected
by harmful gases to the point of causing health problems or any kind of damage.
Therefore, a monitoring system is needed to check the quality of the air 
and send the data to an online server or an application. 

The purpose of this project is to develop and design a monitoring system that
will allow us to monitor and check the quality of air through the 
Internet of Things (IoT). The system will use air sensors to sense 
the presence of harmful gases or compounds in the air and constantly 
transmit the data to the microcontroller then channel it to an online 
server or even Telegram over IoT.

Furthermore, the system will benefit 
the authorities or data analysts to analyse the quality of air in a certain 
area without visiting the site every time they need data. Since the data 
from remote areas can be accessed and saved in the database by using the IoT. 
Therefore, the authorities can take necessary measures to control the problem. 

The beneficiary of this system could be anyone, especially people who suffer 
from respiratory diseases.

The key stakeholders are; the Computer Science dept. team (Dr. Tiwonge Manda and Networking Lecturers), 
Lecturers in other departments.
